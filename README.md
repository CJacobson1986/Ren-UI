# Ren-UI

Ren-UI is a set of React components that loosely implement Material Design specifications.

Check out the [documentation](http://renui.technopathic.me/) site live examples. It's still a work in progress, but you can see where it's going. The main difference between this library and most other UI libraries is the increased speed and reduction of resource use.

# Getting Started
I highly recommend you get to know ReactJS before diving into Ren-UI. Ren-UI is a set of React components so you will gain the most out of it by already knowing ReactJS and JavaScript.

To quickly get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run `npm install` to install all of the necessary libraries.
```
git clone https://github.com/Technopathic/Ren-UI.git
cd Ren-UI
npm install
```
To run the server, simply do `npm run start` and your development website will be on http://localhost:3000.

# Roadmap
Implement Ren-UI has a stand-alone Component Library.
